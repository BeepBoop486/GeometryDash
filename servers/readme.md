GeometryDash will have servers to save data from players and the levels created by them, the "servers" folder contains the code of... the servers derp.

# TODO
this'll be the folder containing the servers of the game, account creation, connection, cloud save and load, level upload,
download and playback, mappacks, gauntlets, etc...
this'll be coded in php, and will be hosted in linux too xd, the security of the server will be tested constantly, trying
to sqlmap and to dos.
